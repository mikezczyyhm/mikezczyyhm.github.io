            <p>RxJava nice and easily covers our multithreading needs.
              But it provides only a half of the solution.
              While we can compose functions with RxJava, there is no safe way
              we can have
              our state (field variables) handled without race conditions and
              low-level synchronization blocks.</p>

            <p>This article describes a simple and practical way for solving
              multithreading issues
              that appear even when we&rsquo;re using such advanced technology
              as RxJava.</p>

            <p></p>

            <h2 id="state-what-is-it">State, what is it?</h2>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&ldquo;State - all the stored information, at a given instant
                in time,
                to which the program has access&rdquo;
                &ndash; Wikipedia</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>For our needs we can say that state is the sum of all variables
              in the application memory.
              State can also be limited to a subsystem, an object, even a
              function can have state.</p>

            <h2 id="object-oriented-representation-of-state">Object-oriented
              representation of state</h2>

            <p>In a usual OO application its state is distributed over a graph
              of interconnected objects.
              When an external event happens, or when a background thread
              finishes
              its execution (at best), it simply mutates the graph.
              The downside of such approach is that complexity of such
              modifications is horrifying.</p>

            <p>You&rsquo;re calling <code>getUserProfile()</code> and you have
              no idea what will happen next
              and which variables will be changed during the call.
              It may read database and update profile,
              it may update your network token,
              it may download new list of unread messages,
              it may change user&rsquo;s age and so on.</p>

            <p>You didn&rsquo;t want all of that while composing &ldquo;Hello,
              %username%&rdquo; string isn&rsquo;t it?
              Especially if you was doing it while filling the profile view and
              you got an update
              callback while processing a previous callback?
              All these events, especially while happening concurrently, can
              give grey heir to anyone!</p>

            <p>OOP model does not have any answers to all these issues.
              Programmer is expected to write callback spaghetti,
              <code>synchronized</code> blocks, constantly
              checking what is going on the other side of the application to
              avoid having conflicts.
              Passing data in OOP is like giving someone a live rat instead of a
              juggling ball.
              You want to juggle a bit, but
              your data can run away or even bite you, suddenly throwing
              <code>NullPointerException</code>.
              Multithreading issues in OOP code can not be reliably solved at
              all.</p>

            <h2 id="functional-state-model">Functional state model</h2>

            <p><a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">RxJava</a>
              is a library for Functional Reactive Programming.
              &ldquo;Functional&rdquo; here stands for composing functions.
              But functional programming is not limited only to composing
              functions.
              What about the other side - state?
              Can functional programming teach us more?
              Sure.</p>

            <p>In real functional languages like <a
                href="https://clojure.org/">Clojure</a>, state is immutable.</p>

            <p>That&rsquo;s it - if you have <code>Rect</code> data structure,
              you can&rsquo;t just change it&rsquo;s <code>x</code> and
              <code>width</code>.
              The only way you can have some state changed - is to make a copy
              of the
              data structure with new values of fields.
              Want to modify a list? Make a copy of it.</p>

            <p>It is a very simple and straightforward practice.
              When an event happens, new &ldquo;state&rdquo; graph is created by
              taking
              the old one with some fields changed.
              And the new graph is assigned to the <em>single</em> variable
              which holds the root of the graph.</p>

            <p>This sounds weird and very memory and performance consuming.
              But in practice the difference is not so big, and what we get in
              exchange for
              a negligible performance hit is outstanding reliability.
              And you still can use mutable data in performance-critical parts.
              Remember the Knuth&rsquo;s cite? It can totally be applied
              here.</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&ldquo;We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97%
                of the time:
                premature optimization is the root of all evil.
                Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical
                3%.&rdquo;
                &ndash; Donald Knuth</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>Because data is immutable
              you don&rsquo;t have to make deep copy of the entire data graph.
              You&rsquo;re not copying <code>String</code> values while passing
              them around, isn&rsquo;t it?
              Because <code>String</code> is immutable, it is absolutely safe to
              pass it anywhere.
              So we only need to allocate the difference between the old and the
              new graphs.</p>

            <p>Let&rsquo;s take an example.
              Here is the representation of state in a currency selection
              dialog:</p>
            <div class="highlight"><pre

    <span class="o">}</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>When user selects another currency, we only create a new instance
              of <code>CurrencySelectionState</code> with the old list and new
              <code>selected</code> field.
              We don&rsquo;t need to copy the currency list itself because it
              was not changed.
              The list is immutable so we can safely reference it from the new
              state instance.</p>

            <p>It can look tedious to write lots of <code>with-</code> methods,
              but in practice it does
              not take too much time. If you&rsquo;re free in selection of
              libraries for your
              project, you can try automatic code generators for such purposes,
              for example
              <a
                href="https://github.com/gabrielittner/auto-value-with">AutoValue:
                With Extension</a>.</p>

            <p>We can also stack such &ldquo;modifications&rdquo; by calling
              them in a chain:</p>
            <div class="highlight"><pre
                class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">CurrencySelectionState</span> <span class="n">newViewState</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">oldViewState</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">withCurrencies</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">newList</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="o">.</span><span class="na">withSelected</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">selectedItem</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>After getting a new <code>CurrencySelectionState</code> instance,
              all we need is to call our
              <code>currencySelectionDialog.update(newViewState)</code>
              to refresh view and the job is done.</p>

            <p>This solution with immutable state and separation
              of state and its representation also becomes very popular
              in web development.</p>

            <p>When we&rsquo;re creating the new immutable
              data structure which represents some state,
              there are just no places where unpredictable things can happen.
              Your jugging ball does not suddenly turn into a rat or a bird,
              it does not try to bite you or to fly away.</p>

            <h4 id="single-source-of-truth">Single source of truth</h4>

            <p>The idea of having a single source of truth fits nicely into this
              approach.
              You have some state and when it changes you get notified. Nice!
              And it is better to have the truth immutable, just to avoid having
              some grey hairs.</p>

            <h2 id="adding-some-rocket-science">Adding some rocket science</h2>

            <p>The article says &ldquo;reactive&rdquo;, was it just do draw
              attention to some weird stuff
              from functional languages? Of course not!
              All the previous discussion was just to prepare you,
              dear reader, to hit the next episode with some ideas about what
              &ldquo;reliable&rdquo;, &ldquo;predictable&rdquo;
              words mean when we&rsquo;re talking about state.</p>

            <p>Let&rsquo;s adopt this model to our reactive multithreading
              environment,
              so we could have a reliable and predictable state management for
              our
              lovely RxJava.</p>

            <p>What we really want is to have these things:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Avoid deadlocks, race conditions, and all the fears of
                multithreading programming</li>
              <li>Make state modification sequential because it usually fits our
                requirements</li>
              <li>Observe state changes in the same sequence as we actually do
                them</li>
              <li>Of course, our solution must be dead simple</li>
              <li>Reusable</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Let&rsquo;s take the example we already have with the selection
              of currency.
              While user is scrolling we want to get next page of currencies
              from server
              in background and when we receive it, we want it to be added to
              our list of already displayed
              currencies. And when we do this we want to have a callback to
              update our view.</p>

            <p>In RxJava we have a similar feature &ndash;
              <code>BehaviorSubject</code>.
              Unfortunately, it does not guarantee sequential emission of items
              on one thread.
              (What if you call it&rsquo;s <code>onNext</code> on different
              threads? Hint: a race condition.)
              It does not have thread-safe way to get current value and to emit
              a new - everything
              is in hands of the user.</p>

            <p>Why race conditions and wrong emission order is an issue?</p>

            <p>Say, we have 10 currencies,
              and when user scrolls down, we want to show a progress bar instead
              of the last item
              on the bottom, and when we get the next page of items, we want to
              add them to the list.</p>

            <p>In case of a race condition we can get items first and then
              progress bar without new items next.
              This is not the most frequent case, but it will happen sometimes,
              especially
              if you&rsquo;re using some tricky caching mechanics.</p>

            <p>There can be much worse cases. Say if we&rsquo;re creating a
              messaging app
              where items can be paged up and down, cached in a database,
              modified, animated, updated -
              we must be very precise and should always get the updated list of
              items in the right sequence.</p>

            <h2 id="usage-example">Usage example</h2>

            <p>Here is how we&rsquo;re going to use it:</p>
            <div class="highlight"><pre
                class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">CurrencySelection</span> <span class="o">{</span>

    <span class="c1">// The state itself.

            <p>This pattern perfectly fits into any architecture.
              You can keep <code>RxState</code> in a view if you&rsquo;re
              adhering to &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care&rdquo; architecture,
              you can put it into a presenter when doing MVP,
              it can represent ViewModel when you&rsquo;re on MVVM,
              and it can be put into any singleton to represent
              a service state, etc.</p>

            <p>Hint: all these <code>addAll</code>,
              <code>unmodifiableList</code> can be too boring to type, so it is
              OK to write
              your own utility functions like <code>List concat(List,
                List)</code> or use a functional
              library with all the primitive functions and immutable collections
              included:
              <a href="https://github.com/mikezczyyhm/solid">Solid</a>.</p>

            <h2 id="it-looks-familiar">It looks familiar!</h2>

            <p>There are currently two approaches I know about that provide
              similar functionality:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>You can go with plain RxJava and use
                <code>BehaviorSubject</code>.</li>
              <li>Or you can use Jake Wharton&rsquo;s
                <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/RxRelay">RxRelay</a>
                library to make it a little bit easier.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>A) Both approaches do not give any guarantees about making
              emissions on one scheduler.
              They will simply emit values on one of threads where they received
              one
              of values instead of emitting all of them where you need it.
              Welcome to writing <code>subscribeOn(mainThread())</code> and
              spaghetti of
              operators to connect other operators together.</p>

            <p>B) There is also no guarantee that emitted values will be
              sequential relatively to each other.</p>

            <p>Say, you want to change values like this:</p>
            <div class="highlight"><pre
                class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">currentValue</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">subject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getValue</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="n">subject</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">onNext</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">currentValue</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">1</span><span class="o">);</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>In a concurrent environment something can change subject value
              between <code>getValue()</code> and <code>onNext()</code> calls
              and the classical race condition will happen - you will get
              repeating numbers sometimes.
              So you need to write poor man&rsquo;s <code>synchronized</code>
              blocks to prevent this
              or you can also limit yourself to one thread and write
              <code>subscribeOn(mainThread())</code>
              everywhere &ldquo;just to be sure&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>Not the best solutions in my opinion.
              I just want to write: <code>state.apply(it -&gt; it + 1)</code>
              and stop constantly thinking about all the multithreading
              issues.</p>

            <h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

            <p>Here is some implementation reasoning:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>We&rsquo;re making modification sequence strict by
                taking the old state to produce the new one</li>
              <li>We do state modification in a lock to prevent multiple
                modifications
                of state happening concurrently</li>
              <li>Each new state is being put into a queue</li>
              <li>Our emissions should always happen in one thread,
                this is the only way we can guarantee their sequence</li>
            </ul>
