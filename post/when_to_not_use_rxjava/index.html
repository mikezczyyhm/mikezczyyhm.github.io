          <h1 class="headline" itemprop="headline">When to NOT use RxJava</h1>
          <section class="body" itemprop="articleBody">
            <p>RxJava is very powerful.
              It solves a great amount of tasks easily.
              But using it in wrong places can turn any codebase into an
              unmaintainable and buggy mess.
              Here I will try to explain where RxJava can help and in which
              cases it is better to avoid using it.</p>

            <p></p>

            <h2 id="basic-example">Basic example</h2>

            <p>Let&rsquo;s take a very simple and obvious example of a wrong
              RxJava
              usage and go into theoretical details later.</p>

            <p>Often, people inspired with RxJava
              start turning everything into a stream.
              We even got a new mantra - &ldquo;Everything is a
              stream&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>Say, you need to implement <code>int max(int, int)</code>
              function (let&rsquo;s pretend it does not exist yet).
              What will you think if you discover an implementation like this
              that was proudly created for you by a newbie who can&rsquo;t wait
              to apply the new magical hammer?</p>

            <h4 id="figure-a">Figure A.</h4>
            <div class="highlight"><pre
                class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">max</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">left</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>

<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>Interesting, yeah?</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>&ldquo;When you have a hammer everything looks like a
                nail.&rdquo;</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>A sane developer will probably say &ldquo;WTF??!&rdquo; and
              implement something
              less shiny and inspiring, but more practical:</p>

            <h4 id="figure-b">Figure B.</h4>
            <div class="highlight"><pre
                class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="nf">max</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">?</span> <span class="n">b</span> <span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">a</span><span class="o">;</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>There is even an option to refactor the old code like this:</p>

            <h4 id="figure-c">Figure C.</h4>
            <div class="highlight"><pre
                class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">max</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">left</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">zip</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">left</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">right</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nl">MyMath:</span><span class="o">:</span><span class="n">max</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>But in practice such a weird <code>max</code> implementation is
              just a consequence of other
              weird functions that for some reason will look better if
              <code>max</code> works with observables.</p>

            <p>This example can be easily scaled into any
              size &ndash; people turn into stream <em>everything</em>
              literally.</p>

            <p>You can easily discover code like this:</p>
            <div class="highlight"><pre
                class="chroma"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="nf">getId</span><span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="n">Observable</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">just</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">id</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></div>
            <p>In a large codebase it happens all the time.</p>

            <p>Or you can find a 20-line function of operators
              that is doing a job that can easily be done without RxJava -
              with the same amount of code!
              Try debugging a flow of events when the person who wrote it
              did not even think about events.</p>

            <p>I&rsquo;m not saying that mantras do not work.
              I hope that at this point that&rsquo;s pretty obvious. ;)</p>

            <h2 id="so-what-exactly-is-wrong-here">So what exactly is wrong
              here?</h2>

            <p>This entire rant is about simplicity.</p>

            <p><strong>Figure B.</strong> says:
              &ldquo;take two ints and return one of them that is
              bigger&rdquo;</p>

            <p><strong>Figure A.</strong> says:
              &ldquo;Take two streams of integers, they will emit values once in
              a while, and there
              will probably be not equal amount of values in these streams, and
              these streams
              will probably will never emit any values, but just take these two
              streams
              and create another one that will wait unless both streams will
              emit at least one value,
              and return a value every time this happens, and the value should
              be
              the maximum of these two values, but if one of streams will return
              less values then
              you should wait unless it will emit something and you should
              buffer
              items of another stream while you&rsquo;re waiting.
              Keep in mind that I
              can subscribe any number of times and you need to create the new
              sequence every time.
              There is also a possibility to unsubscribe at any moment, so you
              will also need
              to unsubscribe from these two streams.
              Both streams can emit new values on different threads
              so you will need to emit the next value on the thread of the
              latest emission.
              Propagate all exceptions and stop stream once it happens.
              Stop returned stream if one of incoming streams stops.&rdquo;</p>

            <p>The enthusiastic developer will probably say:
              &ldquo;But we will never have such conditions!
              Both streams will always have exact amount of values,
              and I&rsquo;m not going to use multithreading here,
              and&hellip; and&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

            <p>C&rsquo;mon, tell this to your mother.</p>

            <p>Bugs happen all the time and one day one of these observables
              will NOT return any value and your app will just hang.
              And it will happen with 10% of all of your users.
              And you will not even get a stacktrace because nothing crashes.
              Or you will get a stacktrace, but it will not change anything,
              because RxJava stacktraces are something special.</p>

            <h2 id="do-not">DO NOT</h2>

            <h4 id="the-absence-of-events">The absence of events</h4>

            <p><strong>Do not</strong> use RxJava if there is no
              &ldquo;event&rdquo;. Just don&rsquo;t.
              If something does not say: &ldquo;this will happen at some point
              in time&rdquo;,
              do not create observables.</p>

            <p>RxJava is not a <em>data processing</em> library.
              It is an <em>event processing</em> library.</p>

            <p>Events are more complex than data
              because, in addition to data, events have <em>time</em> or
              <em>order of execution</em>.</p>

            <p>If you need to process a list of items, do not turn it into an
              observable.</p>

            <p>Besides the complexity that will increase
              for a person trying to understand
              the code, there are other downsides.
              Have you seen RxJava source code?
              It contains quite complex logic, so it is hard to debug.
              It also consumes additional resources to make multithreading
              safe.</p>

            <p>If you want to use functional programming while you do not have
              Java 8 streams,
              just take a third-party library or write a couple of utility
              functions.
              Your code will be much simpler and there will be less
              possibilities for bugs.</p>

            <h4 id="same-life-duration">Same life duration</h4>

            <p>Say, you have <code>Screen</code> and <code>Button</code>
              objects.
              Both operate on one thread, both have the same life duration.</p>

            <p>There are two general ways to pass events between them in OOP.
              You can either set a callback or pass one object into
              another&rsquo;s
              constructor arguments.</p>

            <p>Passing an object into constructor is usually simpler because
              this way you&rsquo;re strictly saying that the passed
              object&rsquo;s life duration
              is at least as long as the object&rsquo;s that is being
              created.</p>

            <pre><code>class Screen {
    
    Button logoutButton;
    
    Screen(Button logoutButton) {
        this.logoutButton = logoutButton;    
    }
    
    onProfileReceived(Profile profile) {
        logoutButton.setVisibility(profile.isLoggedIn ? VISIBLE : GONE);
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>A callback without the possibility to uninstall it
              is another technique that can be used if you need to
              propagate events into another direction.</p>

            <pre><code>class Screen {

    Screen(Button logoutButton) {
        logoutButton.setCallback(() -&gt; doLogout());    
    }

    doLogout() {
        network.logout();
        profile.update();
    }
}
</code></pre>

            <p>However, if <code>Button</code> already exposes an observable for
              click notifications,
              it is OK to use it as it will not require any
              additional lines of code to implement.</p>

            <pre><code>logoutButton.clicks()
    .subscribe(() -&gt; doLogout());
</code></pre>

            <h4 id="reactive-spaghetti">Reactive spaghetti</h4>

            <p>Don&rsquo;t do like this (simplified example):</p>

            <pre><code>.switchMap(it -&gt; serverApi.login(name, password)
    .switchMap(loginResult -&gt; serverApi.requestChatToken(loginResult.loginToken)
        .switchMap(chatToken -&gt; serverApi.doOtherThingsAfter(chatToken))))
</code></pre>

            <p>Do like this:</p>

            <pre><code>LoginResult loginResult = serverApi.login(name, password);
String chatToken = serverApi.requestChatToken(loginResult.loginToken);
return serverApi.doOtherThingsAfter(chatToken);
</code></pre>

            <p>Why the second way is better?
              Because we&rsquo;re not trading ONE event into FOUR.
              When we&rsquo;re developing software we want to simplify things,
              not to complicate them.
              Events are more complex than linear code execution.</p>

            <p>It is easier to modify linear code as well.
              Imagine you decided to wrap <code>login</code> and
              <code>requestChatToken</code> into <code>synchronized</code> block
              to stop some other network interaction in-between.
              It is trivial to do when you have linear code
              but it is crazy hard to do when every your network call can be
              triggered by something
              you can&rsquo;t control.</p>

            <p>Write spaghetti only when there are no other ways.</p>

            <h4
              id="returning-lambdas-implementing-functional-interfaces-by-objects">Returning
              lambdas, implementing functional interfaces by objects</h4>

            <p>If you&rsquo;re doing something the title says,
              there is a very high chance that there are simpler ways
              implementing the required functionality.</p>

            <p>We <em>can</em> replace <em>all</em> methods in OOP using RxJava.
              It is doable but it complicates understanding.</p>

            <p>Java is not a functional language &ndash; it is an OOP language
              with some functional capabilities.
              Java functional capabilities are verbose,
              they are also prone to accidentally making bugs.</p>

            <p>Clean and understandable code design matters.</p>

            <h2 id="do">DO</h2>

            <p>If it seems to you at this point that using RxJava is an entirely
              bad idea,
              there <em>are</em> very good use cases where RxJava really
              shines.</p>

            <h4 id="multithreading">Multithreading</h4>

            <p>Not much libraries compare to RxJava when it comes
              to dealing with multithreading code.
              Having a simple way to schedule function calls on different
              threads
              is priceless.</p>

            <h4 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions</h4>

            <p>When your objects have different life duration, having
              a simple way to manage their communication is very important.</p>

            <p>Forget about writing callback interfaces, lists of subscribers,
              event dispatching loops, and so on.</p>

            <h2 id="good-practices">Good practices</h2>

            <h4 id="side-effects">Side effects</h4>

            <p><em>Side effect</em> &ndash; is when function modifies variables
              outside of its scope
              or makes I/O. Side effects should normally be executed in a
              specific order,
              for example <code>print</code> that prints information to console
              creates a side-effect
              and if you will call several <code>print</code> in wrong order you
              will get wrong output.
              If you modify variables in wrong order you will also likely have
              bugs.</p>

            <p>RxJava has very clear semantic for using it with functions which
              create side-effects. This is useful when you&rsquo;re trying to
              understand someone&rsquo;s code, and it can also save you from
              having
              more bugs.</p>

            <p>Use <code>subscribe</code> function callbacks &ndash; they are
              intentionally designed for doing this.
              You can also use <code>do*</code> operators
              (<code>doOnNext</code>, <code>doOnError</code>, etc) in case you
              need to create a side-effect during chain execution.</p>

            <p>The default way to go is you need to pass data INTO the chain
              from a side:
              <code>flatMap</code>, <code>switchMap</code>,
              <code>concatMap</code>.
              There are more functions which fit this purpose,
              look at <code>Observable</code> definition.</p>

            <p>It is wrong to use other functions (<code>Observable.map</code>
              for example)
              for creating side-effects
              because it assumes that you&rsquo;re just transforming one value
              into another.
              A developer who will try to modify your code
              will think that it is OK to place this transformation into
              a different place, put it into another thread
              or even completely remove it while refactoring.
              If your <code>map</code> was saving the values into a database
              or was showing them on the screen
              then the refactoring will cause bugs.</p>

            <h4 id="simple-first">Simple first</h4>

            <p>Once you need to execute some action in background, it is
              better to implement it as a simple function first,
              and only then wrap it into an observable in case you need it.</p>

            <p>In some cases you will discover that composition of
              non-rx code is <em>easier</em> than having an observable that
              does hell knows what else.</p>

            <p>Simple code can be turned into complex very easy.
              It is hard to do the opposite.</p>

            <h4 id="single-thread-first">Single thread first</h4>

            <p>This is a sub-rule for &ldquo;Simple first&rdquo;.</p>

            <p>Once your function returns an observable,
              it is better to not schedule the returned observable
              on a specific scheduler inside the function.</p>

            <p>Unpredictable things can happen if the caller does not expect
              to get multithreading from the returned observable.</p>

            <p>Excessive jumps from one thread to another can also
              be slower than you can afford.</p>

            <p>Let the caller decide where it wants to schedule actions.</p>
